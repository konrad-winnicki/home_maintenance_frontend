# Kitchen maintenance frontend

## Ionic
This component uses Ionic framework to provide build artifacts for both: web and mobile (android) runtimes.

### Develoment with Ionic

When a preview on mobile is needed:
1. Build production version:
```shell
npm build
```
2. Sync code to Android application:
```shell
npx cap sync
```
If it's the first time the mobile app is created:
```shell
ionic capacitor add android
```
3. Running in Android Studio:
```shell
npx cap run android
```

# User authentication

Oauth2 authentication code flow is used.
Deep links (Android User Links) can include only URI parameters (cookies nor other headers are allowed). For this reason they can't 
be used to securely pass JWT/oauth tokens.

The authorization code is visible in Frontend but it's useless without client_secret that is stored only on backend.
The code is then passed to backend which exchanges it for token.

Used flow:
1. Frontend redirects to Google IdP.
2. Google authorizes user and asks her to confirm requested grants (basic - email only).
3. Google redirects user browser to Frontend (on mobile app using Deep link) - passing authorization code in URL.
4. Frontend extracts authorization codes and requests backend API to exchange it for a JWT token.
5. Backend uses the code to exchange it for oauth tokens within Google and issues its own JWT session token.
6. Backend replies with the JWT token to Frontend.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
